# This Wordpress plugin is a fork of Ross Elliot's User Image Posts.
# It creates a simple user submission form (no login required) 
# and allows the posting of images to the drafts folder of Wordpress blog, up to 6MB in size.
# Users can enter an address which is stored as a custom meta field and geolocated
# by the Geo Mashup plugin (if it is installed).
